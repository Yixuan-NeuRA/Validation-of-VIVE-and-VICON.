The calibrate_V6.mlx is the main code of the VIVE Ultimate Tracker and the Vicon motion capture system data processing. 

Marker_Error_LToe.m, Marker_Error_RToe.m, Marker_Error_Waist, and get_time_offset.m are functions of the main code.

The entire process follows the document Spatial Position Mapping and Synchronisation of Two Motion Capture Systems with Different Performance Characteristics_V1_2026.01.07.pdf

During time synchronisation, since all three VIVE Ultimate Trackers start collecting data simultaneously, the calculated time offset can be applied to the remaining two VIVE Ultimate Trackers once the time synchronisation process of one VIVE Ultimate Tracker is complete.

Parts of the data collected by VIVE Ultimate Tracker and Vicon from participants who agreed to disclose their data were also uploaded for the reproduction of the data processing.
